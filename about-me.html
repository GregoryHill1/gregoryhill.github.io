		<p>My Name is Gregory Hill, and the first thing about me is how motivated I am when it comes to my school work. Reason I say this is never in my life I have tried so hard in school and realizing it is the best part of me and I would not want to take it for granted. Another thing about me is I like to play sports and to be direct I like to play basketball and I'm really good as I believe. Basketball is one thing I like to do to not thing about stuff that bother me so I play to get away.</p>
<br>
	<p> One thing I like to do is play video games. One game in particular is "Fortnite" because its something fun and one thing to play with you friends to just chill and try to have a good time. Another thing is I am very smart. Reason I say this is I am very good in school I pay attention and I and I catch on fast.</p>
